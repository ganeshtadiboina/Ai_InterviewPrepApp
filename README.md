Interview Prep AI is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application that simulates real-world technical interviews. It allows users to choose specific topics, receive AI-generated coding questions, solve them using an integrated code editor, and receive intelligent feedback in real time. This app is ideal for developers preparing for technical job interviews.

Key Features
	•	Topic-based Interview Generation: Users can select specific Data Structures and Algorithms topics such as Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Dynamic Programming, etc.
	•	Real-time AI Question Generation: Uses Gemini API to dynamically generate coding questions based on user-selected topics.
	•	Question History: Previously generated questions and user responses are stored for future reference and learning.
	•	Authentication System: User authentication is implemented using JWT and bcrypt for session management and password security.

Architecture Overview
	•	Frontend: React (Vite), React Router DOM for routing, Axios for API communication, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Zustand for global state management.
	•	Backend: Node.js with Express.js for building RESTful APIs.
	•	Database: MongoDB with Mongoose for schema modeling and data management.
	•	AI Integration: Gemini API for generating questions dynamically.

 
/client     -> React frontend (Port: 5173)
/server     -> Express backend (Port: 5009)
/models     -> Mongoose models for user and question data
/routes     -> Express route handlers (auth, question, chat)
/controllers -> Controller logic for handling API operations

# In /client
npm install

Future Enhancements
	•	Add support for multiple programming languages in the editor
	•	Track user statistics across multiple sessions
	•	Introduce difficulty levels for question generation
	•	Integrate live interview sessions or mock interviews with AI
